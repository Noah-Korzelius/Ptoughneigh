# Ptoughneigh
Ptoughneigh is a bot designed for my own personal use in a discord server as an assistent to dungeons & dragons campaigns.
All commands are prefixed with a '!'

In Version 1, Ptoughneigh can do the following:
#Roll a d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, and d20
#Calculate Initiative and Stat checks given a modifier in a seperate channel
#Send pong when you send !ping
