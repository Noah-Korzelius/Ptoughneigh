# Ptoughneigh
Ptoughneigh is a bot designed for my own personal use in a discord server as an assistent to dungeons & dragons campaigns.
All commands are prefixed with a '!'; to see a list of all commands, please use '!help'

Ptoughneigh is currently in v.2.0.0-alpha.  My hope is to roll out a more complete beta
version soon before eventally making the full v.2.0.0 release later this year.

Changelog:
# major changes:
-removal of stat channel dependence
    Ptoughneigh no longer uses a dedicated channel to track player's stat modifiers.
    Now, players should execute !newCharacter when beginning a campaign to create a new
    character in Ptoughneigh's memory.  Currently, this functionality is limited and changes cannot be made to characters after they are created, so create wisely.
# minor changes:
-various bug fixes for all previously existing commands.
    Many little bugs have been squished, but expect this version to still be very unstable until the beta and full release.
